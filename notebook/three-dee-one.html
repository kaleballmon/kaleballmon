        I spent today showing my 16 year old cousin around
        New York City with my partner.
        
        My cousin raps and he also makes his own beats, and in 2024
        his main influences are <a href="https://youtu.be/S3RSq6J8uzQ?si=phNhDnBF17iqEEti">Lucki</a>, 
        all members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_(record_label)">Opium</a>,
        <a href="https://youtu.be/-pSRoJYErwA?si=b3eXzMh6Eynzxme9">Cash Cobain</a>, and other current rappers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 16 I was similar, making beats for friends and being up on all the
        new music being made. I still am a big rap fan.

        For those who don't know, a big part of this world is 
        fashion. Growing up, I spent a large portion of the money
        from my library job on clothes. I wanted to give my little cousin
        the experience that I wish I had growing up of going into
        the stores I was hearing in rap songs, and seeing and trying
        on the clothes that I saw cool people wearing. One of the most important stops
        we made was at <a href="https://newyork.doverstreetmarket.com/">Dover Street Market</a> 
        on East 30th and Lexington in Manhattan. In the Rick Owens section, there is
        a sculpture of Rick Owens himself on all fours, which is the catalyst for me writing this now.

          This is not the sculpture in Dover Street Market New York, but is similar.

        Post-university, the production frequency of my own art has
        declined due to not having dedicated time to make
        art, which was time that was baked into my schedule in university.
        Also, I haven't been drawn to a particular medium and I haven't been great about
        experimenting or "assigning" myself a medium to start work in.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Recently, I've come to be interested in sculpting. A few weeks ago I had a conversation with friends 
        where I expressed an interest in picking up scultping due to recently
        seeing some works that moved me, and they were very helpful in sharing information
        that would help me dive in. I haven't embarked on any sculpting projects yet, but
        experimenting with the art form has periodically taken up my thinking energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only published this website a few days ago, so what to fill this website with has 
        also been periodically popping in my mind. The perfect storm of seeing the Rick Owens 
        sculpture, having scultping already on my mind, and thinking about what to fill this website with
        inspired me to think about taking the art of sculpting and see what I can translate to the
        web. I've always found the 3D graphics work that
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5tbEHKL-hl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">Happy99 and Stray Rats</a>
        did in collaboration very cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        It did not take me long to learn what a graphics library
        was and find libraries/APIs like WebGL and Three.js. 
        I won't spend time talking about each of these or the 
        differences between them. Mainly because that's not what I
        want to do here. What I do want to do here is submit my
        "Hello, world." of 3D graphics. I expect that I will really
        like doing this, and I'll be sharing more work here. If I 
        don't like it, then I won't make/share any more graphics 
        work and maybe write about why I don't like it.
